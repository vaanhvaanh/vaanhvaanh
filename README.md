## Summary<br/> 
I am an early-career data analyst pursuing a [Master’s in Data Analytics in Business](https://spu.edu/academics/college-business-technology/graduate-programs/ms-management-da) at Seattle Pacific University. 
Since 2022, I have combined marketing and fashion experience with data-driven strategies for campaign visuals, product design, and content production.  
I analyze YouTube Analytics and Meta Business Suite to improve visual storytelling and marketing effectiveness.  
In my free time, I enjoy swimming, gym, and watching puzzle-solving films or sitcoms (*Friends*, *Modern Family*).
